# traversyMedia_Modern-JavaScript-From-The-Beginning-2.0
My code for Brad Traversy's course, available at https://www.traversymedia.com/modern-javascript-2-0. On my quest to become a self-taught developer, I'm writing every piece of code by myself, avoiding as much as possible 'copy-paste' scenarios, so I can internalize the learning materials from the online course.
